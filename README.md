## Kinematic model

A kinematic model is implemented to control the vehicle around the track. Kinematic models are simplifications of dynamic models that ignore tire forces, gravity, and mass. This simplification reduces the accuracy of the models, but it also makes them more tractable. Also, dynamic model parameters are not derectly accessible from provided materials for the project. 


**States**: 

Position (_x,y_), heading (_ψ_) and velocity (_v_) form the vehicle state vector:

State: _[x,y,ψ,v]_

**Actuator values**:

There are two actuators. Stearing angle (_δ_) is the first one, it should be in range [-25,25] deg. For simplicity the throttle and brake represented as a singular actuator (_a_), with negative values signifying braking and positive values signifying acceleration. It should be in range [-1,1].

Actuators: _[δ,a]_


**Update equations**:

The kinematic model can predict the state on the next time step by taking into account the current state and actuators as follows:

where _Lf_ measures the distance between the front of the vehicle and its center of gravity. The parameter was provided by Udacity.


**Model Errors**:

Errors: cross track error (_cte_) and _ψ_ error (_eψ_) were used to build the cost function for the MPC. They could be updated on a new time step using the following equations:
